## Environmental Problem & Framing
northern california + southern oregon?
In recent years, wildfires in California have became increasingly present in the news. These wildfires affect the ecology of the direct environment, people and communities who are located in the area, and the smoke and air pollution can reach communities hundreds of miles away. Prevention measures for these wildfires exist, but are not as effective as they could be and leave room for improvement. This project aims to solve the issue of inefficient prevention strategies by analyzing environmental data to provide two necessary and sufficient solutions to reduce the damage of wildfires in Southern California.

## Dataset Exploration
### Dataset 1: CAL FIRE Fuel Reduction Projects (https://calfire-forestry.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=80d439247b99489a938b09a0d182173c)
This dataset was compiled by CAL FIRE, a governmental organization that is responsible for much of the current policy surrounding California wildfire. We can use this dataset to compare the solutions we will provide with data from the current policies to quantify how ours will improve upon it. Some key variables are described below:
* variable 1:
* variable 2:
* variable 3:
* variable 4:
* variable 5:
* variable 6:

### Dataset 2: Interagency Remote Automatic Weather Stations (RAWS) (https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/nifc::public-view-interagency-remote-automatic-weather-stations-raws/about)
This dataset collects data from Remote Automatic Weather Stations (RAWS), self-contained, portable, and permanent, solar powered weather stations that provide timely local weather data used primarily in fire management. The data from this will strengthen our proposed ideas by comparing times and key variables down below
* Variable 1: Wind Speed
* Variable 2: Relatively Humidity
* Variable 3: Fuel Temperature
* Variable 4: Air temperature
* Variable 5: Rain accumulation


### Dataset 3:
