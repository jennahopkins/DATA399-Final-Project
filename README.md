## Environmental Problem & Framing
Wildfires in Northern California have increasingly burned at high severity due to climate change, historical fire suppression, and land-use change. In response, state and federal agencies have implemented fuel reduction treatments, but it seems current treatment placement and timing are insufficient to meaningfully reduce wildfire severity under modern fire regimes. This project evaluates the effectiveness of existing fuel reduction treatments by quantifying where and when treatments reduce severity and where they fail to identify gaps in current wildfire mitigation strategies and propose data-driven improved solutions to fuel reduction policies that are necessary to address identified gaps and sufficient to measurably reduce wildfire severity. Stakeholders include the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), federal land managers, and local governments, for whom wildfire severity is a risk management and resource allocation problem. Rightsholders include Indigenous tribes and wildfire-exposed communities, for whom wildfire severity threatens safety, livelihoods, and cultural landscapes. The solutions described by this project will not only help prevent wildfires and lessen their severity, but will lead to safer communities, richer and more abundant ecosystems, and healthier people.

## Dataset Exploration
### Dataset 1: CAL FIRE Fuel Reduction Projects (https://calfire-forestry.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=80d439247b99489a938b09a0d182173c)
This dataset was compiled by CAL FIRE, a governmental organization that is responsible for much of the current policy surrounding California wildfire. We can use this dataset to compare the solutions we will provide with data from the current policies to quantify how ours will improve upon it. Some key variables are described below:
* variable 1:
* variable 2:
* variable 3:
* variable 4:
* variable 5:
* variable 6:

### Dataset 2: Interagency Remote Automatic Weather Stations (RAWS) (https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/nifc::public-view-interagency-remote-automatic-weather-stations-raws/about)
This dataset collects data from Remote Automatic Weather Stations (RAWS), self-contained, portable, and permanent, solar powered weather stations that provide timely local weather data used primarily in fire management. The data from this will strengthen our proposed ideas by comparing times and key variables down below
* Variable 1: Wind Speed (continuous)
* Variable 2: Relatively Humidity (continuous)
* Variable 3: Fuel Temperature (continuous)
* Variable 4: Air temperature (continuous)
* Variable 5: Rain accumulation (continuous)


### Dataset 3:
